-> We made a hand model in blender.

-> Made a glove which had an arduino uno, mpu6050 and 3 flex sensors.

-> Using MPU6050(accelerometer), which was mounted on glove, we were able to track trajectory of full hand in environment.

-> Using flex sensors, which were mounted on fingers of glove, we were able to track the movement of fingers.

-> We had to convert MPU6050 output into Quaternion values, which were processed in c sharp file.
